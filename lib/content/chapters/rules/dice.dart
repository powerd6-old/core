# Rolling dice

There are multiple mechanics in the game that require a player to roll the dice to determine an outcome.

In the rest of the book, rolling a dice will be referred to as 1d6 for one dice roll, 2d6 for two dice rolls, and so on.

When rolling dice, these rules always apply:

## Number of rolls

Normally, a player will only 1d6 and use its result, however, there are some cases where the player must roll 2d6 and use the results differently:

### Advantage

If something or someone is assisting the player in the action, or the action relates to a focus which the character has, roll with advantage.

Rolling with advantage means you will roll two dice, then choose the one that is most favourable to you.

### Disadvantage

If something or someone is hindering the player in the action, or the action relates to a focus which you donÂ´t have, roll with disadvantage.

Rolling with disadvantage means you will roll two dice, then use the one that is the least favourable to you.

## Critical rolls

Whenever a dice is rolled and it lands on the number corresponding to your Character's preferred attribute, that roll is considered a critical.

Critical rolls have different effects based on the situation of the roll:

- ${Reference.internal(link: combatCritical.getId(), text: "see ${combatCritical.getTitle()}").toHtml()};

}
