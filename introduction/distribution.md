## A note on distribution

The powerd6 system is capable of running a wide variety of games, as such the books are separated between the core rules, rules expansions and world-building supplements.

Strictly speaking, only the first one (the core rules) are required to play the game, but the other two provide a multitude of pre-created and balanced content for running a game quickly.
